# Fluxer <> Discord Migration Tool
A tool to migrate your profile and servers from Discord to Fluxer. 

This works as a self-bot so perform it at your own risk.

You need Python installed, as well as all some other dependencies, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get any requirements installed.

You also need to grab your client tokens from Discord and Fluxer to run the tool. 

After all that faff is done, you can run `py main.py`
